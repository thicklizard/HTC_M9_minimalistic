synopsys DWC3 CORE

DWC3- USB3 CONTROLLER

Required properties:
 - compatible: must be "synopsys,dwc3"
 - reg : Address and length of the register set for the device
 - interrupts: Interrupts used by the dwc3 controller.
 - usb-phy : array of phandle for the PHY device

Optional properties:
 - tx-fifo-resize: determines if the FIFO *has* to be reallocated.
 - snps,host-only-mode: if present then dwc3 should be run in HOST only mode.
 - snps,nominal-elastic-buffer: When set, the nominal elastic buffer setting
	is used. By default, the half-full setting is used.
 - snps,ssphy-clear-auto-suspend-on-disconnect: If present, clear auto suspend feaure with ssusb phy
   during cable disconnect.
 - snps,usb3-u1u2-disable: If present, disable u1u2 low power modes for DWC3 core controller in SS mode.
 - snps,hird_thresh: If present, will determine the value of DCTL[HIRD_Thresh] which, in turn,
	controls the UTMI sleep mechanism vs. the PHY. Default value is 12.
 - snps,bus-suspend-enable: If present then controller supports low power mode
	during bus suspend.

 - snps,lpm-nyet-thresh: If present, will determine the value of DCTL[LPM_NYET_Thres].
        If BESL value received from the host in the LPM token is less than this value we send LPM ACK to the host.
        Otherwise the device returns LPM NYET.
=======
 - snps,disable-clk-gating: If present, disable controller's internal clock gating. Default it is enabled.
 - snps,has-lpm-erratum: true when DWC3 was configured with LPM Erratum enabled
 - snps,lpm-nyet-threshold: LPM NYET threshold
 - snps,is-utmi-l1-suspend: true when DWC3 asserts output signal
			utmi_l1_suspend_n, false when asserts utmi_sleep_n
 - snps,hird-threshold: HIRD threshold
 - snps,num-normal-evt-buffs: If present, specifies number of normal event buffers. Default is 1.
 - snps,num-gsi-evt-buffs: If present, specifies number of GSI based hardware accelerated event buffers.
	1 event buffer is needed per h/w accelerated endpoint.
 - xhci-imod-value: Interrupt moderation interval for host mode (in increments of 250nsec).
