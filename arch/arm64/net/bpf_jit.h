/*
 * The Xen hypercall calling convention is very similar to the procedure
 * call standard for the ARM 64-bit architecture: the first parameter is
 * passed in x0, the second in x1, the third in x2, the fourth in x3 and
 * the fifth in x4.
 *
 * The hypercall number is passed in x16.
 *
 * The return value is in x0.
 *
 * The hvc ISS is required to be 0xEA1, that is the Xen specific ARM
 * hypercall tag.
 *
 * Parameter structs passed to hypercalls are laid out according to
 * the ARM 64-bit EABI standard.
